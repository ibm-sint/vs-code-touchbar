# VS Code TouchBar

VS Code TouchBar is a WIP project that I am developing to allow for customisable buttons on a MacBook Touch Bar.

## Installation

You can download the VS code extension [online](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Maruan-Alush.vs-code-touchbar) or on the native VS Code marketplace.

## Usage

You can edit your settings in VS code to change what each button does or for those more tech savvy you can edit your settings.json.

```json
"touchbar.test": "test:unit",
"touchbar.build": "build:local",
"touchbar.run": "run:offline",
"touchbar.start": "start:dev"
```

The `touchbar.test` is the name of the button for which your are changing the command and the `test:unit` is the new command that you want it to run.

## Contributing

Funnily enough, I cannot find out how to edit the link to the repo so I will just add it here. The other link is to a private IBM repo so I have moved it over to my personal account and made it public!
